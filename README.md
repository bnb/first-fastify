# First Fastify

A tiny app that'll tell you the most recent version of [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs).

## Usage

Run `node index.js` or `npm start`.

## Dependencies

- [Fastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify) - Web server.
- [Undici](https://www.npmjs.com/package/undici) - HTTP client.
- [semver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) - Semantic Versioning tool.

## Deploy

I've [deployed this site](https://fastfastify.azurewebsites.net/) to Azure App Service from VS Code, and have set up Continuous Deployment so any PR merged will be shipped to prod quickly. You should be able to deploy this anywhere, though.
